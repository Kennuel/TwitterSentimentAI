negative,@united involuntarily bumped your passenger and can't guarantee them another flight for three days!
negative,@USAirways how is it possible that you don't have a call back service? An automated message telling us to call back Late Flightr is so unhelpful.

positive,@JetBlue flight16?
negative,@USAirways @AmericanAir my friends are stranded at KPHL and the representatives there won't even give them food vouchers…any help please?
negative,@United give me a direct number I can call regarding my lost baggage immediately.
negative,@SouthwestAir fyi the link in your baggage incident email redirects to a 404 on mobile. The link auto changes on mobile. Desktop works fine.

negative,@united you really need a better system for handling Cancelled Flightled flights http://t.co/3uBCoAsyws
negative,@JetBlue she waved someone behind me to step forward although I explained what happened and indicated my need to make my flight

negative,@USAirways 40 minutes in baggage claim and no sign of luggage from our flight. UsAirways- your incompetence is overwhelming
negative,@USAirways how aggravating- zone 5 boarded- overhead empty but forcing bag check. Better not loose bag again! flt1727 http://t.co/w3XS6TVpZg
positive,@JetBlue and ask she load the bag for my flight
negative,@SouthwestAir no I wasn't. After over an hour was too frustrated and had to hang up.
negative,@USAirways flight 623 den to phx: flight attdt decides to stay downtown and be an hour Late Flight so entire flight delayed- she better get fired!

positive,@JetBlue Perhaps you need to start recruiting @msbgu 
negative,@USAirways UR employee named VAN @ ticket counter in #Philadelphia. EXTREMELY RUDE! a Father trying to get home to sick kid missed flight.
positive,@SouthwestAir think you have great people working for you.
positive,@JetBlue I only fly Jet Blue
negative,@JetBlue When I got your alert- I immediately started looking to rebook. But we only had 11 minutes from reFlight Booking Problems to catch a flight to SRQ.
negative,@JetBlue come on! Already delayed 2+ hrs on flight 1415 as we waited for the pilot to come from Boston- now you reassign him?! Endless trip.
negative,@USAirways missing our connection due to delay out of @LAS. Told not looking good for tmrw either. We will be stuck in #CLT. Help!

negative,@AmericanAir is there not an email address I can send my issue to? you guys screwed up and rebooked my flight to the wrong day!  please help
negative,@AmericanAir Worst airline ever. We have been stranded for 24 hours because of your 7 hour delay with flight 104 last night.

negative,@USAirways thanks for making me check my bag when the space was empty and to the flight attendant for the dirty look http://t.co/9rx5HOmM25
negative,@AmericanAir Yes. Your service in GUC sucks. Your gate agent pushed a passenger and has been rude to everyone since we got here.
negative,@united ... I want my bag off flight 1142- what do I do now?
negative,@JetBlue it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so. http://t.co/q9n6NZYSpK
negative,@USAirways What a great way to kick someone when they are down. Cancelled Flight a noon flight and rebook me on one two hours south from here tomorrow

negative,@SouthwestAir promised 4 rooms until Wednesday- (wentook3) and the hotel charged us $79 per room because we had a pink paper needed white?
negative,@AmericanAir I did. Should i expect a response in this fiscal year? This calendar year? Never?
negative,@AmericanAir Are you kidding? You don't think I've done that?? I've called dozens of times &amp
negative,@AmericanAir flight 2470 tomorrow- have no idea if we've been rescheduled and can't fix online? Have to talk to an agent yet no one answers?
negative,@JetBlue what's up? Three delays so far- resulting in over three hours of unnecessary- extra waiting.

negative,"@USAirways Best part was hearing the attendant give a voucher to person next to me for hotel at BGR. Then my guy saying ""we don't do that"""
negative,@USAirways he is 8 months old and is suffering from a rare form of cancer. Your customer service agents had no compassion and I am disgusted
negative,@USAirways that you would let us just switch to a different set of flights so we could spend time with the family after he passes away...
positive,@AmericanAir I'm flying with your competitor today- starts with an U and ends with D. I will never make that mistake again. #americanforlife

negative,@USAirways his name is Rett Cavan- he has a gofundme page- and is going to take his last breath tonight. This airline only cares about money

positive,@united on 2/20 Denver AP- gate B91 (destination Santa Fe)- agent Ashley did an amazing job in the face of an angry traveler. Kudos.

positive,@JetBlue flight 1025 JFK to TPA 8:05am on Saturday! One way ticket!

negative,@USAirways why the hell will you not put us in a hotel when you've stranded us. Your message says mechanical issues not weather. #usairways
negative,@JetBlue This is absurd. Should a stranger help my kids if there's a problem? #jetblue http://t.co/LAiGgef9Kj
negative,@JetBlue sadly- no! I have the app- but it also is experiencing difficulties. The flight information boards are keeping me updated.
negative,@USAirways 799 from AMS to PHL today- 3 of 4 flight attendants were downright rude and hostile and made the 8+ hour flight even worse.

negative,@united worst flying experience ever and they tried to blame it on ATC?! I watched them load bags for 30min after boarding 45min Late Flight
negative,@JetBlue Your scheduling skills failed. The delay went from four hours to nearly six. Don't tell me you were snowbound in PBI.

negative,@AmericanAir why a different airport! I have no way of getting to a different airport.
positive,@USAirways pilot says that we are going to take off in 10 minutes. So maybe the systems came back online?
negative,@AmericanAir there is a full flight of customers sitting on the plane waiting for baggage to be loaded on AA 356 in DFW - why? 2 hour delay
negative,.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.

negative,@AmericanAir I am honestly in shock how this process and service compares to my other airline experiences. Not really sure what to say...
negative,@SouthwestAir couldn't be bothered to help with my lost my luggage. Not a single helpful employee owner to be found in BWI.
negative,@AmericanAir Flight  AA1691 LAX to LAS closes too early and gate agents give us hassles #PatheticCX
negative,@AmericanAir lets me get in line for call back in over 2 hours. I'll just hope the 1 ticket left on the flight I want is still there Late Flightr.

negative,@AmericanAir rude gate agent by AA363 ORD-LGA just now. Seems to have a temper. Made me check in a bag that fit INSIDE the sizer.
negative,@USAirways you guys have to be the worst. We are flying into Philadelphia and have only two jetways available for an on time plane.#pisspoor
negative,@AmericanAir I've been on hold for about 3 and a half hours now. Thanks for Cancelled Flighting my flight and not notifying me.
negative,@AmericanAir AA I need a Hail Mary. How do I get from Dallas to Joplin JLN in the next 14 hours. Willing to fly to other airports and drive
positive,@SouthwestAir -U dont have Atlanta to San fransisco in 99$ in the present sale- like u had in the last sale?Im looking for 2 return tickets
positive,@AmericanAir I'm on 1024 into Dallas. Do I have any chance of catching 2238 to Boston? Do I need to run from Gate D6 to A15?.
negative,@united why doesn't my daughter- booked with my gold member miles- get on the upgrade list for her flight tomorrow?
negative,@USAirways what is wrong with you guys and your inability to get planes in and out of Philly on time. Our pilot gave us a answer that was bs
negative,@AmericanAir My baggage is lost- my flight Cancelled Flightled and i get no accommodations? Not even to another airline. At least one free hotel?
negative,@AmericanAir understand the weather but would be nice to hear an apology on the phone when you moved my flight to an inconvenient day
positive,@united is it possible to add a Known Traveler Number to my ticket after Flight Booking Problems?
positive,"@AmericanAir yep- they moved me to 16A as they showed me flying ""standby"""
negative,@JetBlue that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv &amp
negative,@AmericanAir trying to check in for flight. On line not working &amp
negative,@USAirways flight 614 keeps telling a few more mins to take off its been an hour. First time with you not the best #lies #brokenpromises
negative,@USAirways hire smarter IT people if your systems keep crashing instead of some of the mooks you man some of these airports with. #goDelta
negative,@AmericanAir pathetic to have your gate agents lie to my face when you are at fault
negative,@AmericanAir I have been waiting at this airport since 11 am and have to wait until 8:30 tomorrow and cannot get any sort of help!
negative,@AmericanAir of course it wasn't your intention- issue lies in lack of response. she did contact you directly
negative,@AmericanAir this is ridiculous! You all really have terrible customer service and a lack of urgency. Im convinced.
negative,@AmericanAir ah if only we could get through. We've tried for over 2 hrs. Can we call @united?
positive,@AmericanAir you should be contacting her for a refund - dm me and I will provide phone number
positive,@JetBlue aha- ok. Thanks! Was worried there might not be a seat at all :) Will do it at the airport tomorrow then!
negative,@AmericanAir fight got Cancelled Flighted can u help me rebook a flight?  Call center is too busy to answer calls or even put me on hold #yuck
negative,"@AmericanAir agents refuse to help- ""too busy"" &amp"
positive,@AmericanAir versus @JetBlue 
negative,@AmericanAir if this is how you guys work then i will never fly with you guys again.
negative,@AmericanAir my husband and 5 year old son stuck overnight in DC thanks to 7 crew members arguing over who was boarding the flight

positive,@USAirways @AmericanAir Thank you for a couple of easy- hassle free flights today- professional and friendly staff made everything easy!
negative,@AmericanAir I still am not on a flight. Ive been here allll day and now we're not boarding because we're waiting for catering?
positive,@United Claudia in IAH terminal b travel assistance has me all set. Great service. Thank you.
negative,@USAirways @AmericanAir Any word on accommodations for the passengers on US 746 when they arrive in Charlotte? Lot of tired passengers here
negative,@AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded - still waiting
negative,@AmericanAir I made my flight but then still had no update emails when I landed- no info ever sent on that or second flight. Losing my biz.
negative,@JetBlue Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars.  I bet his flight was on time.  #JUSTWRONG
negative,@AmericanAir this is unbelievable and unacceptable. Flight #293. JFK. Everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day.
negative,@AmericanAir Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option?
negative,@USAirways @PHLAirport this is the reason I avoid @PHLAirport and @USAirways like the plague. Glad to see this merger is working well. #dumb
negative,@AmericanAir how hard is it to have catering ready to go?
negative,@AmericanAir all flights Cancelled Flighted tomorrow and that means I'm stranded at the airport for the night... wow.
positive,@united thank you for following up!
negative,@united thanks for making everyone wait in the dark for an hour while Newark tries to figure out which gate to go to. #incompetence
negative,@AmericanAir tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool.
negative,@AmericanAir I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!
negative,@AmericanAir is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg?
negative,@AmericanAir Hi AA friends! My sis's flight AA362 DFW&gt
negative,@united UA1534 has now had 11 different departure times. Wtf. Make up your mind.
positive,@SouthwestAir I have followed you. Awaiting your DM.
negative,@united missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and I get that. Just wish it was handled better
negative,@SouthwestAir sitting in Newark because flight 4179 was Cancelled Flightled for no apparent reason.  All I was told was sorry after 2.5 hrs waiting
negative,@JetBlue I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue
negative,@USAirways @PHLAirport how can a plane scheduled to come in on time and actually happen. Then you bozos don't have any room us. #incompetent
negative,@USAirways @PHLAirport can you pm me w answer if flt to 4278 is still on time. Been on ground over an hr w no gate. Need help. Pls
negative,@AmericanAir really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and @USAirways are useles
negative,@AmericanAir big surprise flight 2330 is delayed. Hopefully not for 6 hours like our flight here.  Thanks again for a sleepless night.
negative,@AmericanAir Same as yesterday's Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful!
negative,@AmericanAir Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days..
negative,@AmericanAir I cannot believe how long flight 759 PHI  is taking. I know it's US Airways but you own it. I would really like to get home.
negative,@AmericanAir not enough push crews for JFK = 1.5 he delay and counting....
negative,@AmericanAir I haven't been rebooked. I called and left my number for a callback but haven't heard anything and my flight is tomorrow. :(
negative,@AmericanAir My flight to @dfwairport was Cancelled Flightled. Mess ensued. Please thank the awesome Marcos (Concierge Key @ GRU) for sorting it out!
negative,@united I honestly couldn't tell you. All I know is that originally we were going to have it brought in from the concourse
negative,@AmericanAir I did 50 times and no one was helpful I'm missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn't want to talk us
negative,@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
negative,@united and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse
negative,@AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight
negative,@USAirways What is happening? Have been sitting in Philly for hours. Pls take care of Flight 759 to Chicago. At least least us know! #soLate Flight
negative,@united and that it would be sent on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat (HDN) from Denver. So I'm hoping its on there
negative,@AmericanAir now I have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which I pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone
negative,@united Hey so many time changes for UA 1534. We going tonight or what? MIA - EWR
negative,@AmericanAir I understand flight Cancelled Flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hrs is not acceptable.
negative,@AmericanAir you know nothing about customer service and I'll make sure everyone knows it
negative,@AmericanAir I’ve been on the line waiting for 40 minutes again.
negative,@AmericanAir AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers' bags.
negative,@JetBlue you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in South Florida bc of your disorganization. #GetItTogether
negative,@united deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. Neverflyunited
positive,@AmericanAir i appreciate your apology. Sincerely. Thank you. That's really all I ever wanted to begin with.
positive,@USAirways Another great flight #FunFlightAttendants. Thanks for showing my dad wonderful customer service. #flt635 #LAX #PHX #SundayFunday
negative,@united might possibly have the worst service on the planet.
negative,@USAirways @AmericanAir. delay and mechanical issues on both my weekend flights. Ridiculous. Will tweet as long as we are delayed

positive,@AmericanAir 3198 to AEX. Is it still going?
positive,@USAirways Can you provide me with info about checking strollers and car seats?  Costs?  Restrictions?  Need to bring 2 seats 1 stroller.
negative,@AmericanAir we need a miracle @slcairport please help flight 1228 get out of here by 640 #FingersCrossed #pleasegod #missmykids
negative,@AmericanAir I tried several times to select seats. The only ones ever available would've cost me $30 extra per seat.
negative,@AmericanAir flight 3056 still sitting at DFW waiting for baggage to be loaded
negative,@AmericanAir unfriendly unhelpful agents. Unannounced gate changes. Delayed flight that we found out about by word of mouth
negative,@AmericanAir yes but we HAVE TO GET HOME TOMORROW!!!! Please
positive,@united can I get on a stand by list from ASE to ORD? I'm the only poor person in Aspen- that's why I'm asking for standby on twitter.
positive,@AmericanAir you wont allow calls? My husband has a ticket but it looks like all the seats are taken? I cant even call.
negative,@AmericanAir I have a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning and the 800 number did nothing! Please! I just want to go home!
negative,@AmericanAir pls tell me how to get a person on the phone asap
negative,@AmericanAir @JimDayTV no- you couldn't care less. That's why their customer service is run by bots
negative,@JetBlue your crew didn't say it was about safety. If they say that I was glad to stay ... Check the information you give to the costumers
negative,@AmericanAir 719. Looks like we are about to get going- finally!
negative,@AmericanAir we are through. I can quit you. I am. The nonsense &amp

negative,@USAirways Can you advise on what's happening with departure delays from CLT?
positive,@AmericanAir everything's good now brothaaaaaa
negative,@united I understand the intention- but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay.
negative,@AmericanAir this is awful customer service.
negative,@AmericanAir Yeah- try harder. No catering truck in sight.  Can we just leave now w/o the food won't eat anyway?
positive,@united Didn't know that buying a seat in first class was just a 'request' to sit in first class! Very Interesting.
negative,@united this is it... Last time I fly #UnitedAirlines  you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ord and miss work.
negative,@JetBlue Why close prechk at 8PM on a Sunday at JFK?  #annoying

positive,@USAirways it's not often that an airline is so easy to work with. I needed to change my flight time and the attendants at MKE made my day!
negative,@AmericanAir at JFK flight to Boston delayed 20 min waiting for catering they are boarding flight to LAX waiting for over and hour WTF?
negative,@USAirways on top of that a dozen ppl missed connections and you have ONE person at customer service? Abysmal!

positive,@united Educate Bohol is a 501(c)(3) w/all volunteer staff. I can help the kids or buy a plane ticket ...I can't do both. Can you help?
positive,@USAirways great- thank you!
negative,@USAirways Really a letter that says you will discuss serving drunks more drinks that doesn't help the current situation
negative,@AmericanAir it wasn't really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot.  Makes a person paranoid.
negative,@AmericanAir I can't choose a seat online because I booked on @priceline ??? #SMH
positive,@USAirways @GregWallace66 Yea- they will give you 5 cents on the dollar!
positive,@AmericanAir thanks to FA Shawn for spectacular service on FLT 79 LHRDFW and to FA Susan for such a warm engaging onboard welcome
positive,@JetBlue @shannonwoodward I'll be checking often. Most probably when they hand the oscars out to the nerds- geeks and badly dressed.
negative,@JetBlue Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems?

negative,"@AmericanAir Why can't you handle your customers needs? Cancelled Flightled flight- 800 number leads to a quick ""Goodbye"" Very Sad!"

negative,@JetBlue by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk.

positive,@AmericanAir Thanks for the reply- but a functioning plane four hours ago was the only way to do that. The staff was friendly- tho.
negative,@JetBlue are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days? You went from $50 to $120 for overweight fees! Outrageous
negative,@AmericanAir Unfortunately that is not true. A robot apologizes and hangs up. So how do I get help?

positive,@USAirways @AmericanAir major issues getting out of Boston- but your crew has been exceptional. Let's see how things roll out in Philly.
negative,@AmericanAir  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.

negative,@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
negative,@AmericanAir It's not your agents
negative,@AmericanAir won't answer the reservation line!  Nice service.  We may be stuck...
negative,@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
negative,@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min- just say we will get you there when we get you there.
negative,@AmericanAir was told at 7pm my bags would 1000% be at my house by 9pm. Well they're not and I continue to be lied to.

negative,@AmericanAir You should be more timely with bags that missed a flight- people need their undies the next morning!
negative,@SouthwestAir first you had a good idea thatthis would happen and did not Cancelled Flight it earlier- then very amateurish that there was no plan.
negative,@USAirways why won't you help me get my luggage back? I'm a teen trying to change the world in DC #Flight5182 #usairways
negative,@SouthwestAir no delay. I pay $777.70 for BS A1 ticket. You boarded flight early. I'm last to board. Now have middle seat. Wasted $$$$!
negative,@JetBlue had a potentially stressful situation in reFlight Booking Problems a flight which she diffused and helped make awesome!
positive,@AmericanAir thanks. Bummer. Poor planning on my part. I assume the card in Passbook won't work either?
negative,"@AmericanAir ""We'll drop off your luggage 24 hours after your flight"" is ridiculous."

negative,@USAirways help! I've been on hold for almost two hours. Trying 2 get home.
negative,@AmericanAir 1 ticket agent servicing at least 60 people on line. Waiting for an hour and a half and your phones hang up on people.
negative,@USAirways CLT- please send more than one cust svc rep to your cust svc counter to assist a line out the door. http://t.co/v24QNp3DOi
negative,@AmericanAir @Expedia are killing me. Over 3 hours to get NO human to help me.
negative,@AmericanAir you guys should really improve the service experience with your on site personnel. This has been one of the worst experiences.
negative,@AmericanAir and let FLT 2350 know I'm coming / gate crew have yet to arrive to let us off FLT 5350 #DFW

positive,@JetBlue you just tight that you're #59 on the world's best airlines list &amp
negative,@AmericanAir delta rerouted 6 of my bags onto aa977 MIA-CUR. How can I see if they made it onto the flight?
negative,"@AmericanAir The delay is nothing but the personnel being so combative up to the point of saying ""what's the hury-  the plane is not leaving"
negative,@AmericanAir i will be writing a very detailed letter to you all about this experience today. I have never experienced such awful cs ever
negative,@united is so cheap they couldn't afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline
negative,@AmericanAir they don't even give an option to hold.. Just say lines are busy Plz try Late Flightr
negative,@AmericanAir we tried. We are headed to a funeral in Cincinnati and your people didn't even tell us we could get on standby.

negative,@AmericanAir just Cancelled Flightled my 7 am flight tomorrow with out informing me at all today- then booked one in 2 days- and no customer service
negative,@AmericanAir You could only get us on a flight 30 minutes before the funeral starts. We're stranded in Dallas w/o luggage for 2 days
negative,@SouthwestAir A-list preferred. DEN-DAL flight Cancelled Flightled 30 min prior to boarding. Best option was Tue afternoon. Seriously?!? Epic fail.
negative,@AmericanAir you all should really be ashamed. The entire business class cabin is empty and almost all of first class...
negative,@AmericanAir because you won't get our bags for us because you said they would go on to Cincinnati even though we can't. Who exactly is

negative,@AmericanAir finally made it to chicago - 13 hours Late Flight.  Did get a $12 food voucher for my wait.about $1per/hr. Never again. Good bye.
positive,@USAirways Can you help with a seat assignment?  5 people flight 694- PHX to HNL- seats are split up.  Anything you can do will be great.

negative,@AmericanAir 37 minutes??????
negative,@AmericanAir Hey so I'm very disappointed with my time traveling with you! I've had the worst experience and both times the flight delayed!
negative,@AmericanAir my understanding is they were able and did for many other flights but chose not to for this one.
negative,@united I understand the intent was not to inconvenience- but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn't an option.
negative,@AmericanAir The pilot told us they would release bags as well as offer hotel vouchers. Neither happened.
negative,@JetBlue But not reddit? I work for the site and this is ridiculous.
positive,@SouthwestAir luv my companion pass!
negative,@USAirways @PHLAirport always nice when a customer service manager threatens customers standing in his understaffed lines for the last hour

negative,@united Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative.
negative,@united can we get an explanation on why UA978 from São Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we're hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations.
negative,@SouthwestAir @fly2midway 45 minute wait for my bags. Just what I needed on a Sunday night.
negative,@AmericanAir I'm getting calls from 1-800-433-7300 but the calls seem to drop instantly. Is there any alternate avenue for resched. support?
negative,@AmericanAir yes and the auto rebook confirmed an outbound that departs after the return flight.  # fire the software programmers

negative,@AmericanAir pretty bad at #DFW no updates two flights behind doors open breeze no America airlines workers http://t.co/6MBK79mdnW

positive,@AmericanAir great flight experience again... SFO-JFK... Dare I say it? A consistent high quality on a legacy airline? Keep it up guys!
negative,@USAirways Missed flight. Rude CSR. No flight till Tuesday. No answer on twitter. Help me out with a RT @pattonoswalt you're my only hope.
negative,@JetBlue the lack of TV made it rough- that's literally why I picked y'all over the competitors.
negative,@usairways @usair   idiots took our plane &amp

positive,@AmericanAir yea no worries. I'm just going home to Denver. Not your fault- weather sucks bad.
negative,@united I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous

negative,@AmericanAir seriously- I do not want to wait 24 hours for a flight when I have to prepare for a family funeral.
positive,@SouthwestAir kudos to the crew of flight 1050 to GRR for making a very special memory for a sweet young passenger- and her Momma. Well done
negative,"@United ""delayed due to customer service"" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1"
negative,@JetBlue Safety might be your priority but organization clearly is not.
negative,@AmericanAir its not that- it's the rude agent who wouldn't listen to anything I would say and it clearly fit into the sizer
positive,@USAirways - Janet &amp
negative,@AmericanAir at some point u need to tell passengers what is going on. At Jfk waiting to get on flight it is a mess.
positive,@AmericanAir she doesn't have Twitter.
negative,@united we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing
negative,@AmericanAir due to gate agents I missed my connecting flight to Mexico City...not a happy customer AA- let's correct this
negative,@JetBlue ð. I think I'll come take a nap at the terminal. 
positive,@SouthwestAir may I have my Companion pass please.
negative,@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
negative,@AmericanAir why do I have to wait for 2 hours to talk to someone when you changed my flight?
positive,@SouthwestAir I know that not everybody on flight can be 1st time flying. But in case it is people in front deplane 1st not from the back?!?
negative,@AmericanAir @DuaneNClark  ever think about being prepared and bringing in more people? Does anyone have any business sense at AA?
negative,@USAirways Thanks for ruining my last night of vacation because I have to worry about my flight because y'all don't have record of it

negative,@AmericanAir I need to speak to a REAL PERSON. My flight was Cancelled Flightled with no explanation- and I've been on hold for more than 3 hours.
negative,@AmericanAir and it gets better...other passengers rebooked direct on other airlines. #whereisthelove 
negative,@united Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent.
negative,@USAirways Just discovered that they billed us $300 for the rescheduled flight- which cost me a second day of lost work.
negative,@AmericanAir not yet. I'm next in the terminal a customer service area.
negative,@AmericanAir @SouljaCoy what is AA going to do to fix their utterly embarrassing customer service? You won't even answer the dang phone!

negative,"@AmericanAir i hope it takes you 6 hours to get home when it should take 20. my flight was Cancelled Flightled because they ""couldn't staff the plane"""
negative,@USAirways you're really fudgin up with all these delays ð¡ #justwantmy
negative,@USAirways The fact we did not get notified hindered our ability to look for alternate flights before they were snapped up.
negative,@united You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won't let us on even though it's at the gate.
positive,@USairways Since I am a loyal USAir customer I am sure that they will make this up to me-right now I want to get home &amp
negative,"@AmericanAir this is pathetic customer service. Why have bag tags- barcodes and computers if your response is- ""not yet located""?"
positive,@united Thanks! LOL! #UA6259 will wait for us. Per @flightaware- same tail number as #UA5525 :)
negative,@AmericanAir employees are racist!!!!!
negative,@united time to give up my 1K status and switch to @Delta - you are so terrible I can't even describe.
negative,@AmericanAir I just checked the app and it said my flight had been moved back a day? No explanations why. No answer on the 800 number.

negative,@united I can't find any Late Flight evening flights. Are there other airports that would have an overnight flight?
positive,“@united: Looking for a reason to travel? #quote http://t.co/GGuIg3t28z”

negative,@USAirways I made a reservation online but I didn't receive any confirmation email. My bank said the transaction went through. Can u help?
negative,@SouthwestAir what robot is running this account. The same one that doesn't remember anything they ask. Same conversation over and over.

negative,@AmericanAir is AA951 to São Paulo taking off today? Your colleagues won't tell us any thing
negative,@SouthwestAir apologies are whatever. Please just deliver the bags like you said you would. Feel like employees are lying to me.
negative,@USAirways we flew out- through and into good weather. when we landed-  another technical issue with gate. improve service or lose customers
negative,@united its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service'

negative,@united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS
positive,@united he is so excellent and so reliable :) #happycustomer

negative,@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
negative,@AmericanAir - Appreciate your system is busy but when I call- having your automated system hang up on me is not helpful.
negative,@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
negative,@USAirways flight #703 Philly -&gt
negative,@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
negative,@united - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.
negative,@AmericanAir Thanks. Two hours to go inflight- then hotel.  Hang in there with all the DFW travel delays AA team.

negative,@AmericanAir by far the best example of the worst company @Cowboycerrone
negative,@AmericanAir @USAirways and our meals are also on us- because this company does not care about their #customers. Truly disgraceful.

negative,@AmericanAir Hey you Cancelled Flightled my flight- and I can't get someone on the phone to rebook (2 hour wait minimum). Can I get some service?

positive,@AmericanAir what's the status of flights for Tuesday out of Dallas??
negative,@AmericanAir @nrosenb1 it says changes can't be made online
negative,@USAirways doesn't let u do stand by on flight due to checked bag causing u to get in 5 hours Late Flightr only to get to PHL &amp
negative,@AmericanAir I have never seen such incompetency from a gate agent in years of business travel DFW B16 gate agent needs training or new job
negative,@USAirways not given option for new flight! Why can't we get a plane PHL-MIA? 20years as an #eventprof this is worst travel experience ever

positive,@AmericanAir I'm going to speak with customer service at the airport tomorrow morning and see what my options are. I need a flight tomorrow
negative,@AmericanAir DFW GATE 16 to BMI agent seriously is beyond incompetent.  Never flying AA again if can be avoided #fail #pathetic
negative,@united I lost my sunglasses on the flight from OKC to IAH this morning (8am takeoff) .. is there any way to retrieve them?
positive,@AmericanAir probably had money on @BensonHenderson they said to hell with @Cowboycerrone lol
positive,@AmericanAir thanks
negative,@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology- just told me to complain online
negative,"@AmericanAir I have ""continued contacting"" your phone reps for 7 hours and am still unable to get through. That's absurd and I am livid."
negative,@USAirways you are the worst.
negative,@AmericanAir @ArminRosen @ggreenwald Tell that piece of shit to get fucked... I'll fly exclusively with you for life...

negative,@AmericanAir not anymore.
negative,@USAirways .... I've been trying to get through to book a reservation and the system will not let me through. Day 3 #ridiculous
negative,@AmericanAir what I am put off by is the fact that no gate supervisor has tried to come by and communicate with us.
positive,@USAirways looks like our bag has been rescued. Thanks!
negative,@united i need help but in spanish
negative,@USAirways you reminded me today why I fly @SouthwestAir
negative,@united Flight 472 from ORD couldn't let me know about this? Found out via app minutes before landing. Awful flight. http://t.co/DQJl8vZ2h2
negative,@united yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further- but unfortunately i was just bounced around.
positive,@united How do I get through @TSA to finally board UA 1534?
positive,@JetBlue mint seats are AWESOME! :-) @emaleesugano best business class in the US!!!
negative,@USAirways denied me standby bc of checked bag in cvg 5163 to Phl @ 6..so I had to take delayed 3751 4 hrs Late Flightr...except u lost bag in cvg
positive,@JetBlue I understand delays.  We are all looking at a tv monitor at ur gate and it says current conditions are snow- hence delay.
negative,@united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2
negative,@JetBlue other jfk to Boston flights went off with some delay but not this.  #epicfail
positive,@united I just booked a flight for (2). When I view my reservation it has MI connected to First name. Is this a problem? can it be changed?

negative,"@united clicked ""upgrade now"" and it didn't upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59"
negative,@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
negative,@united it will be on a different airline.
negative,@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15- 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error).
negative,@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal- but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away
negative,@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
negative,@USAirways Has To Be THE WORST Airline Of All Timeð
negative,@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
positive,@AmericanAir Thanks! Are they really open 3.30 am - 7 pm every day? Any way to check they are open before going all the way there? Thanks.
negative,@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??
negative,@united typical caned response from UA- fix your crappy performing- last placed/ranked airline in this century!
negative,@AmericanAir yes. Shows Cancelled Flightled &amp
negative,@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
negative,@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
negative,@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back- total BS
negative,@AmericanAir Get a new crystal ball. Cancelled Flight flights before weather hits to rebook me on flight during? Looking like 2 nights hotel on me.
negative,@USAirways does anyone from your airline know how to do their job?
negative,@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds
positive,@united Worked like a charm. Bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim. #welldone #goodflight #friendlysky
negative,@SouthwestAir you're right- I do. I've been traveling all day and you guys dropped the ball. Making for a long night.
negative,@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars
negative,@USAirways had mom sit for 3 hours waiting for a flight they ultimately Cancelled Flighted to give her a Tuesday morning flight...no compensation. Ugh
negative,@USAirways your customer service is horrendous. Between the way employees speak customers and their lack of care for problems with flights.
positive,@SouthwestAir Just reading your boarding policy- we're a group of 8 travellers with kids ranging from 3-10- is it possible to sit together?
negative,@AmericanAir first flight is Cancelled Flightled. Been on hold for 4 hours. Need information and getting none. Help?
negative,@USAirways this says it was estimated to leave an hour ago (it hasn't left yet) so thanks for this useful information. #TheWorstAirline

positive,@AmericanAir Joanna did a WONDERFUL job!  Thank her for me?

positive,@AmericanAir booked AA3370 departing JFK 2/25/15. It was booked via BA and I want to change my FF# to AA can you do that for me via Twitter?
negative,@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flightled- website refers to 1-800#- the 1-800# hangs up on me. Not auto-rebooked. Really? Horrible company.
negative,@AmericanAir that's interesting-Agent told me so. Sadly- another booked passenger didn't make it to gate by push back so I made it on.
negative,@SouthwestAir flight Cancelled Flightled. new flight 7 hours Late Flightr. will sleep in airport tonight. and cant even give me an A Boarding Group seat. thx

positive,@AmericanAir I left something on my flight from ORD to SFO earlier today and believe it's on the plane back at ORD now. Please help.
negative,@united  bags left behind because plane overweight- be great if knew as soon as we landed- instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info.
negative,@AmericanAir can I get home before 12 or no?
positive,@united you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
negative,@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
positive,@AmericanAir you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
negative,@AmericanAir can someone actually either call back or help me figure out how I'm getting home??!
negative,@AmericanAir I've been on hold with international award reservations for almost 2 hours. 800-433-7300 keeps calling me. what is going on?
positive,@SouthwestAir you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
positive,@AmericanAir gate agent Jan L at Phoenix was at least able to get my younger daughter seated near my wife. Thank you!
negative,Number or email? That's the purpose of sending you a tweet? @USAirways
negative,@united Nope- no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip.
negative,@SouthwestAir You completely let me down tonight. Your gate agents' ambivalence is just too much. How sad for you (&amp
negative,@AmericanAir when will tomorrow's flight Cancelled Flightlations at Dfw for AA flights be posted? We are on 2424 at 7am from LAX!
negative,@AmericanAir sounding like they just got bitch-slapped by @juliasinton948
positive,@AmericanAir 1) I was on 1610 today to YYZ. I had a bit of a bag issue that was cleared up beautifully. Thank you to all of the check in
negative,@AmericanAir so what are you going to do for me since I can't take the option you gave me. What type of refund will you do for me?
positive,@SouthwestAir I am in- let's do this!
positive,@AmericanAir Understood. Thanks anyway
negative,@AmericanAir it was my friend. She shouldn't have been scheduled so close together at LAX then not reimbursed. It's costing her 12 hrs &amp
positive,@AmericanAir thanks for following up. I think it's fair to refund the ticket price and the two one way rental cars I had to buy.
negative,@AmericanAir please DM me a way to get in touch with someone that can help. I'm platinum AA and considering quitting AA BC of this.
negative,@JetBlue Didn't find out my flight for NY- scheduled to leave at 9:30pm- is delayed by more than 1.5hrs until AFTER checking in. Huge fail.
negative,@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
negative,@SouthwestAir needs to train their employees to be at lease somewhat empathetic when THEY lose our luggage.  Monika at MWA needs a PR lesson
positive,@AmericanAir I was on a flight for tomorrow and my reservation is coming up.  Help me!
negative,@AmericanAir the service received by both of us was rude and well below my expectations of your airline. That is what's most frustrating
negative,@USAirways  ok my 4th try today....giving up at 12.45am after 138 minute hold time. #terrible http://t.co/Ps9Q9RPSiL

negative,"@JetBlue appreciate the response but already spoke to a MCO and their response was ""There is nothing we can do"" idk if that's what you mean"
positive,@AmericanAir - Whoooo Hooooo just crossed 25-367!!! At my current pace I should reach 152-202 for the year.
negative,@AmericanAir why won't u deliver my luggage? Almost two days and holding on the phone for over 4 hrs. Help!
negative,@VirginAmerica I like the customer service but a 40 min delay just for connecting passengers seems too long. VA370
negative,@AmericanAir I understand the weather issues. I don't understand how I was not notified of the Cancelled Flightlation- and had to realize it so Late Flight.
negative,@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?
negative,@AmericanAir flight from PHL to Austin Cancelled Flighted- headed to Houston- delayed- now have to pay to rent a car and drive 3 hrs to Austin
negative,@united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u
negative,@AmericanAir bag turned up- no thanks to your useless call-centre and useless website
negative,@united Not to belabor my point-but shouldn't I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx
negative,@AmericanAir stuck in airplane both on way out of PHL and again in Houston. All passengers frustrated. Makes me want to avoid airline
negative,@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever

negative,@AmericanAir I am running out of battery you have my chargers-clothes-coat-contact lenses- need to be in mtg tom need help #pathetic service
positive,@AmericanAir will do. I'd think- though- that a literally identical itinerary to your sample itineraries would work - maybe need to update?
negative,@JetBlue Woo! Update! Flight 915 is now possibly delayed by more than 2hrs!  Power of positive thinking- people.
negative,@AmericanAir wasn't offered a flight out of PHL until TUESDAY so had to ask to be booked to Houston instead of Austin.
negative,@AmericanAir I've been on hold ANOTHER hour and still nothing. My Cancelled Flighted flight was supposed to be six hours from now. #Stranded
negative,@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
negative,@AmericanAir Finally got a call from AA- but it was an automated voice that hung up on me! I called back &amp
negative,@AmericanAir Your agent sent our family on 3 diff planes to dfw that were as Late Flight due to delay as the Cancelled Flighted plane that started this #fail
negative,@AmericanAir  MY FLIGHT #2962 OUT OF CLL @ 0600 WON'T LET ME CHECK IN. PLEASE HELP. #IMPORTANTFLIGHT
negative,@United Over the last week- United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united
negative,@AmericanAir ... Do I have to even say anything?  Over 6 hours on hold... No one has ever sucked as much as you. http://t.co/NcrMqIBIWo
negative,@VirginAmerica And now the flight Flight Booking Problems site is totally down. Folks- what is the problem?
negative,@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
negative,@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.
positive,@united UA flight 1247. SFO to LAX took my carry on at gate. I'm Group 2- overhead bins are empty
positive,@JetBlue last sleep in Cali... back to JFK tomorrow night.  Looking forward to an another amazing flight with you all :)
positive,@AmericanAir can you please connect these two reservations together and also add a child in a lap. KEVOLT and SOZLDJ march 1. Thanks
negative,@AmericanAir Err 2 hour wait time for the Exec. Plat. line?
negative,@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
negative,@AmericanAir Yes and without my bags. 2 first class tickets to Tahiti would be nice. Just saying
negative,"@AmericanAir Also- been on hold for 30 minutes with your ""customer service"" to find out when my new flight is scheduled bc your site SUCKS"
negative,@AmericanAir now we are all stuck on the plane after landing because crew unable to figure it out
negative,@AmericanAir overall lack of attention or foresight when managing flights.
negative,@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after - not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United
negative,@AmericanAir seriously- there aren't any reps available to take phone calls? Even for platinum?
negative,"@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night ""as fast as they can""- you should reconsider what you think that means."
negative,@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays)- and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?
negative,@united thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted
negative,@AmericanAir this has happens so many times. It's just upsetting to see how poorly an airline treats their customers
negative,@AmericanAir Flight #2390 delayed 14 hours!! No one at #AmericanAirlines counter can tell my husband that he will be on that flight! Help???
negative,@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member- but the lack of communication was really bad. Also- i don’t see that it has taken off yet
negative,@AmericanAir you called back just to put me on hold. It's midnight. Literally just want to know how I'm getting home and I'm getting no help
negative,@AmericanAir  Did you guys just give up helping people? Your phone tree just hangs up on me and I have a flight tomorrow. Connection pending
negative,@united Actually- the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ
negative,@AmericanAir Worst airline. You Cancelled Flight flight- don't let me know- I wait on hold 30 mins- told to enter callback for middle of the night?!!
negative,@USAirways the call hung up on me..
negative,@AmericanAir - for the past 5.5 hours- call volume is so high that no one can take my call to Cancelled Flight my itinerary? #YoureDoingItWrong 1/2
negative,"@AmericanAir To think that I'm a ""Priority Member""! Wonder how you treat the plebes. I know which rewards card I'm Cancelled Flightling immediately."
positive,@JetBlue wall separating in row 1. #safetyconcerns http://t.co/zTrDwV0N4l
negative,@AmericanAir - Hanging up on customers with no chance for a callback is a failure of customer service. 1:30am EST and no one can answer? 2/2
negative,@USAirways who's in charge of your company? My wife missed her connection to CA you sent her luggage on another flight
negative,@AmericanAir do you have the phone number of a supervisor i can speak to regarding my travels today
negative,@USAirways now U horrible people say you have no where for her to sleep?
negative,@united what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm- finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp
negative,@USAirways Do you have any pride in your service? Any concerns for my wife and everyone else on that flight? Or you just don't care????!!!
negative,@AmericanAir Why offer automated call back option when agent is available only to call me &amp
negative,@AmericanAir The word failure means: an act or instance of failing or proving unsuccessful
negative,@USAirways has to be the most lazy- inconsiderate- and unprofessional airline that I have ever traveled.
negative,@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight tomorrow (without telling me) and I want to rebook-please help me book a new flight! What # can I call?
negative,@USAirways is the worst airline to ever travel with.
negative,@united checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity
negative,@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled- another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??
positive,@united I wanna be ride United airline! I love airplane
negative,@JetBlue flight was two days ago. Flight 1918 from POS.
negative,@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
negative,@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
negative,@VirginAmerica Use another browser! 2015 &amp
negative,@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
negative,@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service- LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why...
positive,@united I wanna be grand staff
negative,@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled my flight- rescheduled to EWK gave me a pseudo-voucher that directed me to the worst @daysinn in existence. #fail
negative,@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
negative,@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp
negative,@AmericanAir thanks for your apology but it's a bit Late Flight. Cancelled Flighting a flight more than 24 hrs in advance due to weather is ridiculous. We
negative,@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
negative,@united Tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message. How can I tell if it went through? http://t.co/JbDkxd6eFz

negative,@USAirways But nope!  Apparently this is the way you guys do business!  I guess I'm flying southwest and her blue from now on.
negative,@united appreciate it- but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue
negative,@AmericanAir I've been on hold for 4 hrs- no call bk either. Family of 4 trying to get from HDN to DFW flight 1418 direct. Need new info plz
negative,@USAirways you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest.  At least they treat their customers properly.
negative,@USAirways Like I thought this was America.  When did US Airways start operating under the rules of communist Russia?
negative,@USAirways sorry doesn't help.  It's midnight PST.  How in the hell am I still on hold after 90 minutes on customer service line?
negative,@USAirways And how do you only have 1 agent at PHX customer service desk when an hour ago the line was over 100 people long?

negative,@AmericanAir I would like to be reimbursed for my shuttle from Denver after #1080 diversion 6+ hours sitting in plane and mech problems
negative,@USAirways What was the point of the merger?  Why not just go out of business if your not turning a profit anymore?
negative,@USAirways your a miserable airline and your loss of revenue is a reflection of that.  Go extinct.  A merger only delays the inevitable
negative,@USAirways pls get me back to Tallahassee:( no one should ever have to be stranded in Gainesville for this longð

negative,@AmericanAir highly disappointed in the baggage service with this merge with @USAirways you guys have lost our 1st bag and now missing items

positive,@VirginAmerica Love the team running Gate E9 at LAS tonight. Waited for a delayed flight- and they kept things entertaining
negative,@AmericanAir yes we did make it home. But by no means am I happy. I've always chosen AA as my 1st choice when flying- I'm rethinking that...
negative,@USAirways What a mess caused by the computer systems. Flight 719 in 3 hours Late Flight and now no gate for us. Est 26 min wait.
negative,@AmericanAir No it isn't -  sheer incompetence was reigning at DFW today. I was there. On a plane on the GD runway. I doubt you were.
positive,@USAirways on a happy note our 719 crew is wonderful. Can't say enough great things about our pilot. He's doing all he can for us.
negative,@AmericanAir what sense is it to charge for a bag service when the service isn't great. Losing luggage and now missing items this is bs
negative,@USAirways three hour wait and counting waiting for reservations on the phone. Are you serious!?
positive,@VirginAmerica your beautiful front-end design is down right now
negative,@AmericanAir is the 24/7 phone line open? On hold for over 2 hours now. Your check-in agents cannot help at the airport itself. Please help.
positive,@AmericanAir Why did  AA973 return to JFK? Thanks :)

negative,@AmericanAir hey I got a call saying our flight was rescheduled but I can't get through to anyone to see if you're providing a hotel for the
negative,@AmericanAir extra night we have to stay in San Juan now. How can I check on that?
negative,@AmericanAir but really- can you DM me on here to verify if you've booked a hotel for our extra night here? Kinda unsettling to get a call
negative,@AmericanAir at 5 am and have no clue if we have a place to stay or not
negative,@SouthwestAir thank you for Cancelled Flighting my flight- last minute of course- to #GIS2015. I'm now missing one full day of my trip thanks to this!

positive,@AmericanAir airport to figure this out or can someone tell me now? Flight is from San Juan to San Diego
negative,@AmericanAir Thank you for the worst experience ever on an airline- from me to you- I hope your embarrassed as an airline. Pathetic
positive,@AmericanAir Can you respond to my DM?
negative,@AmericanAir I was just called abt my flight Cancelled Flightlation- a flight that was Cancelled Flightled at 10:30a Sunday. Two 4:00a calls are not okay.
negative,@AmericanAir love how you can't get an agent on the phone and the automated system hangs up on you
positive,@AmericanAir we have been rebooked due to weather- but need to change our reservation and fly on the 24th- instead of the 23rd.
negative,@united please stop spending mktg $ on branding ads. Use savings to improve #cxp. 1hr wait for luggage due to short staff is unacceptable
negative,@AmericanAir that all AA is for USAir Elite members. It's one big disappointment in the way we are treated. #epicfailure
negative,@AmericanAir why wont you find my luggage without blaming everyone else?
negative,@AmericanAir who do I need to talk to to get a full refund on my trip? Your call center offers no assistance.
negative,@AmericanAir are you ignoring me on purpose? It was sad enough having your automated system hang up on me ð
negative,@USAirways merging with American will negatively affect your quality and integrity. I will no longer fly with you because of it.
negative,@AmericanAir waited in the airport for two days to get home- not weather reLate Flightd. Dealt with horrible customer service. Finally switched to
negative,@AmericanAir westjet and your rep won't do anything about my lost luggage- which I never even checked with westjet because it was lost in

negative,@united First complaint filed on Feb 11th- over 10 days now and still no response....disappointed but not surprised....
negative,@AmericanAir @nickcunningham1 Except now there is no wait time- the phone system just hangs up on you. So continuing to hold won't help.
negative,@AmericanAir been on hold for for over two hours. After waiting 2 hours earlier. Can't get any info on my reservation. How is that ok?
positive,@AmericanAir @USAirways wonderful FC FA on flight 2062 pre dawn!  Nice start to the day!

negative,@united I would encourage you to re-interview the sole flight attendant on UAL 6166 from BUF to ORD. Blatantly not stable. Uncomfortable.
positive,@united basically- I need to leave from Hawaii Late Flight evening (midnight) and get back to Philly Late Flight Monday night. Most trips get me in Tues
negative,@SouthwestAir - really?  All other carriers are staffed and you've got a triple looped one and no employees in sight in OKC
negative,@united Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS
positive,@VirginAmerica is the best airline I have flown on.Easy to change your reservation-helpful representatives &amp
positive,@AmericanAir Thanks guys- you got it. I'm heading to Milan on Wednesday- so big week with the AA family :)
negative,@USAirways as the employee responsible for social media content- yes u probably do care however the actions from last night say otherwise

negative,@united literally sucks
negative,@AmericanAir yes but you did manage to lose two of our bags. Horrendous airline.
negative,@AmericanAir Your rubbish at Social Media! In the air two hours Late Flight but that's better than being Cancelled Flightled!
negative,@USAirways your computer system went down ok that is understandable but the agents make it worse by not helping her or anyone else
negative,@united Do you have a further update on the suitcase today please.

positive,@SouthwestAir got an email confirmation of wifi purchase on a recent flight. Trouble is- I've never flown with you. Ever. #concerned #scam?

negative,@USAirways I have never had a more unpleasant travel experience in my life. Now I might not get on my flight till tomorrow? This is insane
negative,@AmericanAir bad weather happens but lack of preparation is inexcusable. Depending on good weather is not a good business model.
negative,@AmericanAir has been almost a month and still no response to my online complaint/questions. Out $300 because of it.
negative,@united Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry.
positive,So relieved I'm flying @JetBlue after listening to everyone at the neighboring gate bitch about Spirit. My airline's better than yours.
negative,@AmericanAir HELP U said ud chnge our retrn flght since we missed our connection Sat &amp

negative,@AmericanAir you flew me into Chi instead and I got a ride to MKE. U said my bags would go to MKE today. Is it on the Cancelled Flightled flight tho?
negative,@AmericanAir why is does it seem to be impossible to contact anyone at your airline to get an item left on board a plane 5 min after deplane
negative,@SouthwestAir The problem is apologies don't help. Results matter and it's proving impossible to find anyone who is interested in that.
positive,@JetBlue everyone is overreacting. Keep up your swag!
positive,Never got to the strip that fast before. Stoked for special @Imaginedragons show tonight! Thx again @SouthwestAir! http://t.co/ToPqmVqnJp

negative,@USAirways patience is what my connecting flight will need. Why do you guys do this to me every time I travel? Every. Single. Time.
negative,@USAirways And you took away my 1st class seat.  Love being a Chairman Preferred and assigned row 24 seat B middle seat
negative,@USAirways do you operate ANY flights without maintenance issues? Flights in/out of DCA Cancelled Flighted- this is getting old. Update fleet pls!
negative,@united @dfpietra THAT'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology
negative,@AmericanAir Bad weather is understandable but your own pilot said that over 160 people called out and that ZERO bags are on the plane.

positive,@united Thanks to Karen Salisbury at IAH for amazing customer service!  Found my daughter's bag lost on UA1516.  Made her day!
positive,@AmericanAir the folks at the Executive Platinum desk are great pros.  They understand my displeasure with change fees and switch to SW.

negative,@AmericanAir Are you people cruel or just stupid? Why are you posting my personal email on the damn Internet? Have u lost your mind?!
negative,@AmericanAir you ever wonder why you find yourselves responding to so many customer complaints on twitter? It's because your airline sucks.

positive,@SouthwestAir if I am enrolled in the ATL companion pass offer and booked 3 flights already before May 17 when can I start using the pass?
negative,@AmericanAir the issue wasn't a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn't let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.

negative,@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
negative,@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
negative,@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
positive,@SouthwestAir thanks!
negative,@united That's correct—I've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
positive,@united I appreciate your efforts getting me home!

positive,@USAirways no worries- your flight attendant took care of it.

positive,@united Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver.
negative,@united Soooo- it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?
negative,@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!
negative,@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
positive,@AmericanAir  TPA - ORD!!! AA1679 Another successful journey- thanks for the hospitality!

negative,@JetBlue not one of my four flights this trip has been on time. What the he'll is your companies problem?
negative,@USAirways yes- but we were answered and put back on hold while they were to check on our request..  50 mins Late Flightr nothing!
negative,@SouthwestAir disappointed in the 'service' I've received. Checked in online- checked my my flight status online- CHECKED IN AT THE AIRPORT
negative,@AmericanAir she sent you an email 2 customer service the night it happened ur response was basically 2 bad sorry how should she contact u.
negative,@USAirways : Was on flight 2046 BOS-CLT on 2/22- awful experience- exit row seat was so narrow that I could not move my legs! Unacceptable.
negative,@united was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
negative,@AmericanAir I really wanted to sign up for your airline credit card but your absurd $400 change fee to switch my flight made me think twice
negative,@USAirways well I thought they had hours ago but just found out that no I do not have a seat
negative,@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
negative,@united I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I'm asking for all 50 people to be refunded.
negative,@AmericanAir If it's in my backpack- why do I need to see agent?
negative,@AmericanAir thanks for making this the worst flying experience ever. 4 different planes of mechanical issues and 12 hours and counting
negative,@AmericanAir I had an advantage # and you deactivated it. I don't think you should deactivate a customers acct without their knowledge #help
negative,@AmericanAir we have posted your response on facebook for everyone to see people are appalled by your lack of concern
positive,@united Thanks for the reminder. It's been a fun ride. http://t.co/pPVA4Rch9f
negative,@AmericanAir LITERALLY just told me they'd rather have an empty seat than my mom get to come earlier &amp
positive,@USAirways yes- with Delta!
negative,@AmericanAir of delays and trapped on planes with no water or air. Never ever ever again. #neveragain #aafail
positive,@united not just refunded- but for those of us who are on vacation to get a free room night to make up for making us sleep in DIA
negative,@JetBlue I understand why ur doing it. But for someone who just traveled 2+ hours to get here early. Relax b4 flight etc. Adv notice maybe??
negative,@USAirways finally spoke with someone. I have to email the refund dept. I love you guys- but 6 hours in line to be told no dice sucks.
negative,@JetBlue if I had made as many mistakes as you in as short a period of time. I would I have lost my job at this point!!!
negative,@SouthwestAir Twitter cust svc rule 1 Dont say IF we fell short. I just told u u did! #2 If u cant solve problem don't say anything at all!

negative,@united UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked.  Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave.  Can you help?
negative,@SouthwestAir has become like every other airline #crooked I can't believe they are taking over $500 #shouldwearmasks #shocked
negative,@united @AmericanAir spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet
negative,@AmericanAir seriously- all flights from Detroit to Dallas are Cancelled Flightled 2 days in a row. I want to get home &amp
negative,@JetBlue - I did- but since I was stranded in SYR without a ride I missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter. (4 hours)
negative,@USAirways no i use to skyscanner and travel agency and i called u . You said you should call travel agency but
negative,@USAirways Yes &amp

negative,@USAirways travel agency said that if usairways accept we will refund money i dont understand why dont u refund
negative,@AmericanAir You found my lost luggage- won't bring it to me until tomorrow. Next day if the weather isn't nicer. Terrible service
positive,@AmericanAir thanks
negative,@USAirways ... I f@$%ing hate you.
negative,@united After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&amp
negative,@USAirways you say to call travel agency and they say we cant refund because usairways didnt accept this.
positive,@SouthwestAir in flight wifi + @TMobile wifi calling makes for the best combination. Who doesn't love texting 40-000 feet in the air :D
negative,@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack?
negative,@JetBlue - I did that as soon as I realized. Will they try to figure out who is stealing from people's bags? Security cameras? Anything?
negative,@usairways that wasn't the issue. Someone finally helped on the phone. Now theres a website error that won't let me process my request. SMH
negative,@AmericanAir so disappointed with this airline never again will I book with you guys
positive,@SouthwestAir Do you know the reason flight #336 from Dallas to Midland was diverted to Lubbock? Was suppose to be direct to Midland.
negative,@SouthwestAir your welcome. It was the thoughts of nearly the entire plane.
negative,@AmericanAir on flight 1074 that has been delayed for hours over human errors like a food truck hitting the plane- now the lines are frozen.
negative,@AmericanAir This is getting out of hand. I called Reservations to reserve the seats that it won't let me select online and there's a fee...
positive,@AmericanAir jet slides off icy taxiway at @dfwairport 
negative,@united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea)- and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool
negative,@JetBlue - Hopefully that will help someone in the future. Would there have been a different procedure if I had discovered the theft sooner?
negative,@united UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
positive,@AmericanAir I've just received the ticket. Thank you for your help
negative,@united yes I filed a claim &amp
negative,@AmericanAir WHAT IS GOING ON?  This is pathetic. Online doesn't work and phone wants $25 to give a seat assignment.
negative,@USAirways has the worst customer service line.  I've called them 8 times today and not once was I able to talk to a real human being.
negative,@united has once again let me down. Don't think I've ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.
negative,@united Late Flight to Denver- Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable.
negative,@USAirways you are the actual worst.  You have zero respect for your passengers. I'm officially done flying with you.
negative,@AmericanAir Again you guys are a huge joke and Cancelled Flight your flight for no reason. This is the 3rd time in one trip for me that you have
negative,@AmericanAir Cancelled Flight my flight saying it is cause of weather condition when it was the only flight that was Cancelled Flight
positive,@SouthwestAir reference #: 261093929756
negative,@AmericanAir your assistance has not been very helpful frustrating disappointing experience &amp
negative,@AmericanAir This is getting a bit ridiculous when and you have made me miss 2 full days off work and had to pay for cabs back and forth
negative,@AmericanAir airport and 2 extra nights for hotels and not once have I heard of anything from your embarrassing airline saying that you will
positive,@united where is my flight voucher?
negative,@united yes in Lusaka- Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD.
negative,@JetBlue but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?
negative,@SouthwestAir won't let me send a DM because they don't follow me.. #lovedflyingwiththem #notanymore #wrong #badpolicy
negative,@AmericanAir Pay for my accommodations when you are the ones Cancelled Flightling it for no reason and I know your saying (lying) it cause of weather
negative,@AmericanAir this is the biggest joke I've ever seen and will be telling everyone never to use you guys cause you are a joke
negative,@JetBlue - Definitely no note from whoever stole from me.
positive,“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/Vxn2J36M7V” this happened
negative,@AmericanAir seats that were assigned are inappropriate for child this age. AA knew age of child.
negative,@AmericanAir thx for the apology.   A commitment to fix your broken system would be better.  Actually fixing it would be better still.
negative,@JetBlue you delay all my flights. Then you redirect my gate. Then you tell me had we stuck with the original gate we would have 1/3
positive,@SouthwestAir What an awesome flight Dallas 2 NY. Virgin America refused bc of my child's peanut allergy but u guys didn't. Thanks! ð
negative,@united Why tell us flight is delayed- then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!
negative,@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
positive,@SouthwestAir should offer cdn border towns incentive to fly since exchange rates are #hurt. #customerappreciation #gaincustomers #keepem2
negative,@JetBlue we would have been up in the air by now. Now our new plane we've been redirected to has mechanical errors aka more delays 2/3
positive,@United an idea: monitor mileage members travel patterns enough to know when they change jobs/lose status...and make the transition easier.
negative,@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
negative,@JetBlue you can do better than this. And you can do better for me and all the passengers. #flight108 jfk to pwm.
negative,@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
negative,@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp
negative,@AmericanAir @louprice13 @aacustomerservice. Apology not good enough. 4 planes with mechanical and 9 hours delayed unacceptable.
negative,@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
negative,@USAirways was transf- held 15-18 min more b4 agent answered and helped. By time I got to person fare I'd seen was gone.  Had to get supv.
positive,@JetBlue try harder. Take a winners attitude to your work.

negative,@USAirways my frustrations are the result of multiple experiences Late Flightly. Currently lost luggage. I want to talk to a real person.

negative,@AmericanAir we had to sit in the airport a long periolodicly time. the planes were nasty
negative,@AmericanAir I booked it on US Airways site. Don't see a Cancelled Flight link :(
positive,BY THE GRACE OF GOD- I MADE IT! “@USAirways: @__RWG__ We don't have those powers in here. We hope you can make that flight.”
negative,@USAirways yeah I know that but that doesn't get me my money back does it- everytime I fly with you something bad happens.
negative,@USAirways really???  NOT ONE OF THEM CAN BOOK DIVIDEND MILES TRAVEL - Literally on hold now since 9:50pm - it's 11:30pm #NoExcuses
negative,@USAirways yay for glitchy tracking system!  My bags made it to my destination and not Laguardia like the app said!

positive,@united man I can't wait to book my ticket now! Thanks JP you're a life sabe

negative,@USAirways honestly - how is it quickly as possible I've been on hold sine 9:50pm? Everyone that answers has to send me to someone else.

negative,@AmericanAir My sister just received a call that her trip Wednesday (flts 2348/3499) was Cancelled Flightled and resched to next day. Why?
negative,@USAirways membership has no privileges anymore - my son is in the army- short window to see him - NO help.
negative,@united tried calling too- but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway
negative,@JetBlue full to capacity. I also pid extra for these seats. Perhaps the crew could be more helpful.
negative,@AmericanAir yeah and what are they gunna? Nothing your whole organization is a joke

negative,@united we needed them here asap. Will they make it on today's flight?
positive,@AmericanAir Joanne from your San Diego staff was phenomenal! Give that girl a raise. She handled our #flightnightmare better than anyone.

negative,@JetBlue customer service says since my wife setup a family account that she now can't join mine for a year???  Help me fix please.

positive,@SouthwestAir forget wedding fairs. How about discounts for nonprofits? We donate part of our worth every single day
negative,@USAirways  I open the credit card and earn 44-000+ miles- and you wont' credit the miles to my account to restore the forfeited miles
negative,@USAirways No I was there 12 hrs early! Send me an email to share my experience You don't want this blasting here.

positive,@USAirways The help/complaint forms on the website can be used only if the matter applies to an actual ticketed flight
positive,@USAirways  My tweet gets me a response to email dmsc@usairways.com
positive,@JetBlue Hey guys do you have a tail number assigned yet to flight 1373 for tomorrow?
positive,@AmericanAir No apology necessary. It was wind and I was on Delta. XOXO
negative,@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
negative,@USAirways   My email gets me a canned response that it takes 10 days for mileage to get credited --- It's been three months and my miles
negative,@AmericanAir my mom tried also. That wasn't the reason they wouldn't change it. Y'all literally said that you'd rather have an empty seat.
negative,@USAirways  Three months and my miles haven't been credited.  No one is going to read the email I sent.
negative,@USAirways  I'm glad this airline is going to be swallowed by American!!! American always picks up the phone and solves problems.
negative,@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
negative,@USAirways  I've never been treated this badly
positive,@united But thanks for asking

negative,@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
negative,@USAirways  A few years ago I lost over 50-000 miles bc I was physically unable to fly during the period.  I submitted a doctor's note.
negative,@USAirways  Instead of fair treatment- I got a nasty letter from a lady in senior management that illness forfeits miles like death.
negative,@AmericanAir So break whatever you want- take no responsibility..Too bad for customer? #media #filmcrew @chicagotribune @WSJ #nytimes @CNN
positive,@AmericanAir Thank you
negative,@AmericanAir I'm at the airport right now and your people didn't know how to react and help me with this situation. Very frustrated.

positive,@AmericanAir do you have hand sanitizer in the bathrooms on your flights?
negative,@united If it's any consolation- your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights.
negative,"Nice try @AmericanAir I heard your crew whisper ""she's still at the hotel- she probably doesn't think she has to work until tomorrow"""
negative,@AmericanAir You're clueless. A kind rez agnt contacted USAir 4me around midnite- told them what to do. If not that I'd have missed funeral.
negative,@AmericanAir you've got to be kidding. Look at the pictures.  I'm hoping it's on the flight that just came in. The whole story is 2 much
negative,@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.

positive,@AmericanAir I FOUND MY FOOTAGE!! :D I am so so happy.
negative,Hey @united why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight- and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier
negative,@AmericanAir your online site doesn't have flights listed in chronological order- resulting in a mis-purchase. Anything that can be done?
negative,@AmericanAir there are no more flights via united when I arrive to DFW and my car is parked at IAH ð
negative,@AmericanAir There are only 24 hours to Cancelled Flight or change itineraries booked online and that 24 hours is just about over. Impossible scenario
negative,@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6

positive,@AmericanAir I love the service and cheap upgrades American Provides! One of the best airlines ever! good food- good seats- amazing thanks!
positive,@AmericanAir @BoeingAirplanes I really would love to experience first class on that plane-looks stunning!
negative,@united it's frustrating- as a frequent flyer- loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket.
positive,@JetBlue after my second call to customer service and the fifth person I talked to- an amazing rep fixed it in about 5 mins! :) #persistence
positive,@AmericanAir followed!  Sure hope you can help!
positive,@united we just flew with United from AUS (Austin Bergstrom) to Cancun Intl. Best flight ever! The 737's are not too big... Not too small!

negative,@djevolutionhd As an EP who travels 125K+ miles a yr with @AmericanAir - I would expect more from them than this horrible travel experience
positive,@AmericanAir btw you guys should consider making a lounge at Austin Intl. airport! Very popuLate Flightd area! Will help the company for sureð

negative,@AmericanAir arrived +-10pm eastern. Had to deplane on the CRJs airstairs to an icy Tarmac. Valet bags sent to carousel- so it was 10:20pm.
negative,@united I take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us A so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything #fail
positive,@united yes I do.
negative,@AmericanAir TSA. When I tried to check in the things I've bought your people told me it was Late Flight to do it. So... I want my things back
negative,.@AmericanAir how about connecting me with a customer service rep? I'd rather speak to a person than a computer. Thanks!
negative,@united The bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. Hope you're having a good night. Thanks.

negative,@SouthwestAir hey remember that time you lost my husbands bags? I do. 
negative,Why doesn't @AmericanAir allow for conversations between upset customers and their customer service?  #worstcustomerserviceever
negative,@AmericanAir If SNA curfew causes diversion- do you provide transportation from LAX? On AA1237 now- pilot not sure if we have time.
negative,@USAirways - thanks however I feel like the system has failed me -- what is the solution?
negative,@USAirways flt 1820 2rsw could have extended the courtsey of waiting 2min 4 10 of us.... gates closed in r faces.  Ur fired
negative,@united what is that going to do for you? Nothing just like you always do
negative,@united yes- but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!!
positive,“@united: @MelanieSpring We'll see what we can do. ^KN” We are running! Most of this plane is running. Thanks for the help!
negative,@united But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing...
negative,@AmericanAir it's not only my bag...it's the complete lack of respect when I called. I was hung up on. And it is my daughters bag
positive,@united thanks! Will you guys be getting the A380s anytime soon?
negative,@USAirways can't get back lost time
negative,@AmericanAir please allow me to speak with someone. A dialogue would solve this issue better and faster than emailing.
negative,@AmericanAir 2284- four hours Late Flightrs and we are finally flying out...too bad I missed my event
negative,Why doesn't @AmericanAir provide a means for dialogue?  What is the fear that drives this decision?  #worstcustomerserviceever
positive,@united I send you an urgent message via eservice@united.com.  BG0KWM   Narayanan. Please respond ASAP. Also- NO local United Tel # @ KUL
negative,@united The agent that met us at the gate said any issues w/delays on UA1116 would have to be taken up online...
negative,@USAirways the disappointment was not the bag but that it arrived before me and I was kept 12 hrs without options in IAH
negative,@united okay ase24766m. Find our luggage.
positive,@united This is NOT a local UNITED number for Malaysia   0011 800-55558000. What is your local United Airlines here in Kuala Lumpur ( KUL )?
negative,@united no Cancelled Flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in Late Flight. Getting runaround for 3 hrs. Each employee blaming  previous 1.
negative,@USAirways yes it landed at 11:40am. Should not take another 12+ hours to go 40 min drive. Was assured I would have this am.
positive,@AmericanAir thank you! My lost item was located at ORD and is being returned to me.
negative,@lindaSWC @united:  We don't like to hear you had a poor experience. Please share details w/our Customer Care team http://t.co/HIsc4NdMgZ.
negative,@united Outbound 2 bags 70 lbs bags Returning home 1 bag 50 lbs. What is your logic? And WHY? Am I writing to a Machine? Human HELP required

negative,@USAirways yes but again valuable time has been lost
positive,@united you are one great airline ❤️
negative,@AmericanAir I DM'd you
negative,@USAirways is utterly unreliable! They didn't schedule a pilot for their US624 flight out of Seattle - flights are delayed #usairwaysfail
positive,@USAirways Thank You for your empathy there is more to this story than just the luggage but thank you for reaching out
negative,@united so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can't leave! #FAIL
negative,@USAirways : You Make the Reservation
negative,@AmericanAir hey! I have a name issue on my reservation can you help?
negative,@AmericanAir is the worst airline in the entire world. I only flew them because I had to and it was the nightmare I knew it would be.
negative,@VirginAmerica hi! I just bked a cool birthday trip with you- but i can't add my elevate no. cause i entered my middle name during Flight Booking Problems ð
negative,@USAirways pilot forgets to show up to work and Ricky J (gate agent) gives customers attitude. #usairwaysfail
negative,@USAirways are people going to answer our calls?
negative,@AmericanAir nothing to do with Mother Nature- more like poor commutation.
negative,@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
positive,@united I would like to know what's going on before his current flight lands.
negative,@AmericanAir yeah- buy me a @Delta plane ticket from San Diego to Detroit so I can fly one of their planes home tomorrow
negative,@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
negative,@AmericanAir I understand that but I'm hoping I can rectify this in advance. I would call but I am in AUH. I just need my one checked bag.
negative,@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!
negative,@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew-  7 hours from now- when the plane is already here.
positive,@AmericanAir Thx! I hope so. IAH to DFW to OKC has turned out to be a LONG trip today and I have to work tomorrow.
positive,@AmericanAir but your flight crews &amp
negative,@united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen- how you deal defines a company. Never again United.
negative,@AmericanAir after running from one flight- because we had 10 mins- to our next flight- we then sat on our plane for an hour.
negative,@AmericanAir you guys Cancelled Flightled my flight for today and booked me for tomorrow- so unfortunately i have rebooked. Thanks
positive,@AmericanAir we then had to deplane- and change planes.
positive,@AmericanAir and btwn gate a8 &amp
negative,@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..

negative,@AmericanAir i have been rebooked for the 7am flight. My questions is- why do some people get hotel and the others don't like myself?
negative,@AmericanAir pity that a machine replied- or perhaps my story not unusual. Expected better response given article in in-flight magazine.
negative,@AmericanAir after losing my bags for 4 days&amp
positive,@AmericanAir just hoping/praying for a safe flight. They've had to stop and de-ice our plane yet againð

negative,"@SouthwestAir Yo- I'm trying to make a change to a reservation but whenever I select the flight it says- ""Unable to price"". Please help!"
negative,@AmericanAir this delayed bag was for my friend Lisa Pafe. She got her bag after 3 days in Costa Rica. Issue no updates on your system.
negative,@USAirways - 800# referred me back to baggage services but I left the airport. I was on seat 17A
negative,@united Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
negative,@United  My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome
negative,@united just flew to #TelAviv paid $100 from a third suitcase which didn't even make it on the plane! Besides for the impolite service...
negative,@SouthwestAir My first call got dropped. Waited 15 mins for the second but ran out of time. Will try again Late Flightr. No way to do this online?
negative,@AmericanAir that doesn't really answer my question. Maybe if I provide more details you can give me clarification...
positive,@AmericanAir None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary.
positive,@AmericanAir I know. Just a little cold weather humor. :)
positive,@AmericanAir When will the old 777-200 fly ORD-PVG get upgraded?
negative,@united. ..I received on other flights. #united  truly breaks guitars. #unitedbreaksguitars #wantmymoneyback
positive,@AmericanAir origin/destination/dates are the same. Going from US Airways connecting flight to AA direct flight. Award is saver level.
positive,@AmericanAir my key point of confusion is whether I can make this change even though the initial Flight Booking Problems was on US Airways metal?
positive,@AmericanAir I'd like to apologize to the gate agent for flight AA76- I was not aware that zone 1 was after the nine other precious gems.
negative,@AmericanAir can u help rebook passenger via Twitter/DM.  Been on hold for 1.5 hours. Thanks!
negative,@AmericanAir I'm not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place.
negative,@united - Why can't I get a boarding pass for my Austrian Airlines codeshare flight. Rebook incls a 6 hour layover &amp
negative,@AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight- and it seems due to poor communication- which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff
negative,@AmericanAir said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws- but United does- why is that?
negative,@united rude rude
negative,@AmericanAir robocalls me with another Cancelled Flightation. And then when I don’t accept the change it won’t let me connect to an agent. Just wow.
negative,@AmericanAir but- what I can always rely on when I fly USAir or American is that employees will be rude and unhappy.
negative,"@USAirways She spoke with someone this AM and was told that breast pumps aren't medical equipment and that she should have ""planned better."""

negative,@USAirways I don't want your sympathy I want someone to make an effort to find my bag

negative,@united When will email address/username sign-on be available? It's been a while.
negative,@USAirways And- the helpful employee who changed her boarding zone so that she would have space for her pump is now being disciplined #fail
negative,@united A measly $50 e-certificate is not how you appreciate loyal customers after they wait 3hrs on the tarmac during UA1116. #unacceptable

positive,@united flying gla-mco in a few weeks. How long do we have to be at airport for before departure for both international and domestic? Ta
negative,@SouthwestAir poor performance all around! Paid for Express checkin weeks ago and can't even leverage it #bullshit
positive,@AmericanAir I did
positive,@USAirways Well I did miss it. But gate agents had rebooked boarding pass waiting when I landed. Time for lunch &amp
negative,@united Gate agent hooked me up with alternate flights. If you have a way to PREVENT the constant issues- that would rock.
positive,@SouthwestAir once again on Glassdoor's Best Places To Work snagging # 15 overall #notsurprising #LUVthem
negative,@AmericanAir thx for responding. I cant watch 2 mins of this film w/out it cutting in and out 4 prolonged prds of time. beyond frustrating
negative,@SouthwestAir Been on hold 34 min so far trying to book seat for my infant. Price increased $42 in meantime. What do I do?
positive,@AmericanAir thanks
positive,@united I understand- but it's tough when there is no way to get to the airport w/o serious risk of an accident. It's a steep price.
positive,@SouthwestAir can you follow me so I can send you the info?
positive,@SouthwestAir love them! Always get the best deals!
negative,@USAirways thanks 4 making it impossibly expensive 2 change 2 a flight leaving less than 24 hrs earlier than my reservation #1lesscustomer
positive,.@AmericanAir just disappointed with the Flight Booking Problems process and add’l fees to sit together on a more crowded flight. Not impressed so far :-/.
positive,@SouthwestAir thank you so much completely made things right!
negative,@JetBlue Hey guys- why did my last flight earn me 0 pts? http://t.co/1syWlmTZek

negative,@USAirways Been stuck for 40+ minutes due to lavatory issues. No beverages. No snacks. No customer service. Flt 645 to PHO... #fail #refund
negative,@USAirways I finally got through on the phone after a 2 hour wait time.
negative,@USAirways ok...i know doors close ~10 minutes before takeoff. stop telling me my flight will leave in 20 minutes when we haven't boarded.
negative,@SouthwestAir your agents were the ones who were rude and unhelpful and prompted my initial tweet. This is so easy to fix.
negative,@AmericanAir your planes made me miss 2 connections in 2 days. Thanks for nothing
positive,@AmericanAir Do you have any sort of live chat feature? We're in the UK right now and that call would cost us alot. :(
positive,@USAirways shout out to Cathy at the Vegas airport check-in for hooking us up!
negative,@USAirways always fun to get screwed out of an earlier flight (that isn't full) #crummyservice #whydidntiflysouthwest #goodluckamericanair
positive,@JetBlue check DM please :)
negative,@united you think you boarded flight AU1066 too early? I think so.

positive,@united even on international flight Glasgow to the U.S.? Then what about orlando to Newark? All 90 mins?
negative,@SouthwestAir Very frustrated for the loooooong wait time to speak to a live person!!! Cannot get boarding pass for flight tomorrow!!
positive,@SouthwestAir I'm teaching new #travelers how to research- #budget &amp
positive,@VirginAmerica What @dhepburn said.
negative,@united Your ERI-ORD express connections are hugely popular .. now if only we could have an ERI-EWR hop! :)
negative,@AmericanAir it's not just frustrating--it was PAID for! how do we get a refund?
negative,@AmericanAir 1hr 46 min. Cost of flight change $788. Was $188 2hrs ago b/f drop call. Cancelled Flighted flight. Asked 4 refund.
positive,@AmericanAir is the new 9:45 time confirmed or it may get Cancelled Flightled? Traveling with kids- need to be certain. Thx
negative,@AmericanAir I slept in the miami airport due to mechanical issues and was given 10-000 bonus miles to try and make it right. #slapintheface
positive,@AmericanAir 767 seconds from touchdown at Madrid airport in April 2013 #AvGeek http://t.co/1yWXRfn0Gr

negative,@USAirways flight 645 to Phoenix deboards passengers going to Salt Lake City because they can't resolve a simple bathroom issue. #fail
positive,@united thanks -- we filled it out. How's our luck with this? Is it common?
positive,@USAirways agree! Richard P. Literally ripped up our tixs in our faces and made rude- inappropriate comments to us and our family. Awful!
negative,@AmericanAir aa employees were rude and unwilling to help. 10-000 miles is a rotten cherry on top of a dog shit Sunday. #nocareforcustomers
positive,@USAirways we were moved to a delta direct. Thank you for the accommodations!
negative,@united Delayed due to lack of crew and now delayed again because there's a long line for deicing... Still need to improve service #united
negative,@USAirways is not the new @AmericanAir is more like the new @SpiritAirlines. Love AA. Not impressed with the subpar planes and gate agents.
negative,@united still no refund or word via DM. Please resolve this issue as your Cancelled Flightled flight was useless to my assistant's trip.
positive,@AmericanAir Believe me- I understand. Flight #2955. Was originally booked for Sunday. Flight was Cancelled Flighted and rescheduled for today.
negative,@AmericanAir sorry so Late Flight- responded to your DM.
negative,@AmericanAir no thanks.  As I said- being denied miles that expired one week ago was the last drop for me
negative,@AmericanAir stranded for 24 hours in MIA- Patrick casimir has been the ONLY AA staff to apologize for the great inconvenience #unreal
negative,@USAirways you're killing me from the inside
negative,@SouthwestAir Hello - been on hold for extremely long time. Have confirmation # &amp
negative,@JetBlue They weren't on any flight- they just came Late Flight. Your JetBlue employee just informed us!
positive,@united Thanks for taking care of that MR!! Happy customer.
positive,@united thanks
negative,@AmericanAir why would I pay $200 to reactivate my points that are only useful for certain flights that aren't even worth $200?
negative,@AmericanAir thanks for getting back to me. But I will find other airlines in the future.
positive,@AmericanAir we've already made other arrangements ourselves.
positive,@USAirways never received such horrible service or treated so poorly as Richard P. today. No excuse for attitude &amp
negative,@AmericanAir why would I even consider continuing your point program when I received no perks or continued bad customer service? #senseless
positive,@JetBlue flight 1041 to Savannah- GA
negative,@USAirways just hung up on me again.  Another waste of an hour of my time.  How am I supposed to book a one way award flight?  #badwebsite
positive,@USAirways Fortunately you have staff like Lynn S. and DeeDee who actually understand customer service and simply being NICE.
negative,@SouthwestAir although I'm not happy you Cancelled Flighted my flight home tomorrow (phx to atl then dca) I am happy on how easy it was to rebook
negative,@SouthwestAir still waiting. Just hit one hour.
positive,@JetBlue I hope so because I fly very often and would hate to change airlines.
positive,@USAirways is a DM possible if you aren't following me?
positive,@JetBlue Yesterday on my way from EWR to FLL just after take-off. :)
negative,@USAirways and when will one of these agents be available to speak?
negative,@USAirways  is there a better time to call? My flight is on Friday and I need to change it. Worried I may be on hold until then
